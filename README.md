# My First CPU Emulator in C

Welcome to my first C program! This is an emulator for a simple CPU that I created as part of my learning process. It simulates a basic CPU architecture and can execute a set of operations.

## About the Project

This project is still in its very early development phase. It is a CPU emulator written in C that simulates a basic CPU's behavior, such as loading programs, performing arithmetic operations, branching, and handling memory. The CPU supports a range of opcodes for various operations like `ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `XOR`, and more.

### Key Features:
- Basic CPU with 16 registers
- Stack-based memory management
- Program counter and flags (zero, carry)
- Simple instruction set with various opcodes
- Emulates instructions like `NOP`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `JMP`, `LDI`, and more
- Can load and execute programs from a file

## Current Status

- This is my **first C program**.
- The project is still in the **early development stage**, and many features are missing.
- **Inconsistencies are expected** since I am a novice in low-level programming and this is my first time working with C.

## Contributing

Since I'm still learning, **any contributions, suggestions, or feedback** are more than welcome. Iâ€™m open to improvements, bug fixes, or optimizations. This project is an excellent opportunity for me to improve my programming skills, and I'd love to hear your thoughts or have you contribute.

### How to Contribute:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your feature/fix
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to your fork
5. Submit a pull request

## Things I'm Learning
- **C Programming**: I'm still learning C, so any advice on improving my code or structure is appreciated.
- **GitHub**: This is my first time using GitHub, so I'll likely make some mistakes. If you spot any, let me know!

## Disclaimer

This program is for educational purposes and might not be the most efficient or polished code. As mentioned earlier, this is just a beginner's attempt at creating a CPU emulator. I appreciate your understanding!
