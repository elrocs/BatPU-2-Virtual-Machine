# My First CPU Emulator in C

Welcome to my first C program! This is a virtual machine for the [BatPU-2](https://github.com/mattbatwings/BatPU-2) that I created as part of my learning process. It simulates RAM and the CPU architecture aswell as the display and input peripherals.

## About the Project

This project is still in its very early development phase. It is a Virtual Machine written in C that simulates 

## Acknowledgements

I want to take a special moment to thank **[Mattbatwings](https://www.youtube.com/@mattbatwings)** for his incredible work. His series of videos building a **CPU in Minecraft** has been an invaluable source of knowledge for me. Thanks to his tutorials, I've been able to better understand complex concepts related to processor architecture and low-level programming.

I highly recommend checking out his YouTube channel, as he offers educational and entertaining content that has helped me a lot in my learning journey.

Thank you, Mattbatwings!
